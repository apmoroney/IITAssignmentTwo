## Machine Learning

Machine learning is a product of artificial intelligence in which programs have the ability to learn and improve by themselves, without needing to be programmed by a human. This is achieved through observing data and recognising the patterns within to create predictive models for future scenarios. This data can include anything from text, images, clicks on a website and more. If there is a way to digitise the data, it can be processed in a machine learning algorithm (Hao, 2018).

The concept of ‘Machine Learning’ first came around in the 1950s. It was coined by a researcher at IBM named Arthur Samuel, who developed a program for playing checkers. The program made decisions on its next move based on the highest probability of a reward. This kind of algorithm is referred to now as a ‘minimax algorithm’. As the program developed, it was able to recall all positions it had already seen and combine this with its reward function (Foote, 2019).

In 1957, a program called the Perceptron was built at the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory. It was based on a model of brain cell interaction and Samuel’s research in machine learning. The Perceptron was able to recognise certain shapes in images but struggled with more complex structures such as faces (Foote, 2019).
Machine learning research continued with some success over the years until the 1970s, when a researcher named Geoffrey Hinton, sometimes referred to as the father of deep learning, came up with the concept of ‘backpropagation’ (Foote, 2019). Hinton later elaborated on the topic in a paper published in 1986. Backpropagation allows a program to readjust layers of nodes (similar to neurons in the brain) inside itself to handle new situations. As an error is discovered at the output, it is then passed back through the network layers to improve the program (Foote, 2019). It wasn’t until the 2000s that computer processing power caught up to really make the most of this technique.

Machine learning algorithms can be classified into different categories (What is Machine Learning? A definition, 2020). These are:

**Supervised machine learning algorithms**
These can apply what they have learned from a known, training dataset, to new data using labelled examples to make predictions. It can then compare its output result with the correct or intended result and fix any errors in its own model.

**Unsupervised machine learning algorithms**
These are used when the learning dataset is unclassified. The algorithm will infer structure and patterns for itself, which may be hidden. It doesn’t necessarily display a ‘correct’ output, only patterns and inferences from unlabelled data.

**Semi-supervised machine learning algorithms**
As the name suggests, are a hybrid of supervised and unsupervised. They use both labelled and unlabelled data for training. This type of algorithm us usually chosen when there is difficulty in obtaining labelled data.

**Reinforcement machine learning algorithms**
This type of algorithm creates its own data by interacting with its environment and discovering errors and rewards. They are able to discover ideal behaviour in a certain context to maximise the reward.
An example of this might be AI that learns to play games better than world champions, such as Chess, Go, or League of Legends.

These machine learning algorithms power much of the technology we use on a daily basis. They continue to be the basis of new technologies employed across a wide range of industries (Foote, 2019). Some of these include:

**Recommendation Systems**
Employed by streaming services like Netflix or YouTube. They have processed mountains of data and recognised patterns in what people tend to watch. They can then present something that you are likely to be interested in to keep you on the platform.

**Voice Assistants**
Applications like Alexa or Siri have learned from recordings of thousands of hours of human speech. They are now adept at matching people’s natural language to appropriate words.

**Fraud Detection**
AI can analyse transactions online and predict unlawful activity. If you have ever travelled overseas without telling your bank you may have had your credit card automatically blocked by this technology.

**Dynamic pricing**
Online retailers such as Amazon can adjust their prices to achieve the highest profit based on listed prices and demand.

In order for a machine to learn effectively, and most importantly; accurately, it requires huge amounts of data and time to process it. Machine learning can be combined with other AIs in order to improve its efficiency. Jeff Dean, a Google Senior Fellow, describes the current process of Machine Learning as inefficient and computationally expensive. When we want to apply Machine Learning to a task, we start from nothing, describe the problem, and then compile a relevant dataset in order to train the model (Dean, 2019). He describes it as akin to a person wanting to learn something new, forgetting everything they know, then learning about the task from scratch as if they were an infant. Dean anticipates the goal of Machine Learning to be a single, multi-functioning uber model. This model will be able to take new problems and use specific, relevant pieces of itself to handle the task, rather than starting from scratch every time (Neo, 2019).

A technology that will have a huge impact on the future of Machine Learning is Quantum Computing. As mentioned above, Machine Learning relies on the processing of huge amounts of data in order to be effective. Being able to run these algorithms on quantum computers will significantly reduce the time it takes to process information and run simulations and tests (Rose, 2020). Also, more efficient unsupervised algorithms will play a huge role in the future of Machine Learning. They are able to make inferences and find patterns for themselves in ways supervised algorithms using labelled data from humans cannot.

Dean’s vision of an omnipotent Machine Learning algorithm is still a while off yet. Until then, the next big advancements will come from computer vision and natural language processing. A major area of application for computer vision is the medical field. There already exists technology for assessing and mapping blemishes and growths on the skin, which has improved the diagnosis and early catching of skin cancers (Early Detection of Skin Cancer: Artificial Intelligence can Help to Save Lives, 2019). Locations around the world with limited access to medical professionals will benefit the most. Diabetic Retinopathy, a diabetes complication that affects the eye, requires an extensive eye examination to be diagnosed. Rural areas without access to the required medical professionals could rely on computer vision to analyse and make an appropriate diagnosis (Neo, 2019).

A world full of intelligent machines able to outperform humans at complex tasks is not considered a good thing by all. A major concern for many people is how the growth of AI and Machine Learning will affect jobs. As computers become more efficient and accurate than humans at performing tasks, many jobs will become redundant. It is a valid concern, but it was also the same concern workers had during the Industrial Revolution in the late 1700s and early 1800s. Many economists believe that as some jobs inevitably disappear, new jobs will appear. People will find ways to manage and use these new technologies that are difficult to predict (Vardi, 2017). In more recent times, job titles such as milkman, elevator operator, or switchboard operator have disappeared, and been replaced by new titles such as app developer, social media manager and data scientist (AI and the Future of Work, 2018). The future of jobs in a world filled with AI will rely on creativity and entrepreneurship.

For now, for the average person, we can expect to see the applications of Machine Learning in the technology products we use, and the websites and apps we engage with. Algorithms that already read our behaviours and understand our browsing and buying habits will continue to become more advanced. More targeted advertising that even takes into consideration factors like time of day, life events, or emotional cues can be expected. Dynamic, personalised interfaces for apps and programs are also on their way. Personalised layouts can improve customer retention and give businesses a greater chance at selling you their product (Rose, 2020). Also, products like Google Home or Amazon Alexa, will continue to improve and understand the nuances of human speech better.

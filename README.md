Introduction to IT Assignment Two - Group Project

Hi everyone. This is a shared repository for keeping track of our contributions to Assignment Two.
We can sort out how to do the final document for submission at some point later. This is just to start tracking our early work.

### Instructions

<ol>
  <li>Click 'Add File' > 'Create New File' and create a Name.md file
    <ul>
      <li>This will be your personal document that you can mess around with. Nobody else will edit it.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>At the top of the page give your file a name and enter some content if you like.</li>
  <li>At the bottom of the page, select either 'commit directly to the master branch' or 'create a new branch and start a pull request'.</li>
  <li>Click 'commit new file' or 'propose new file' depending on your selection
    <ul>
      <li>GitHub will guide you through the steps after this</li>
      <li>If you make a pull request, you will have to wait for me to approve the request before it is visible in the repo.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Add any content you write to your file directly in GitHub
    <ul>
      <li>Feel free to write it up in a word doc and just copy/paste it here later</li>
      <li>Guide to styling .md files if interested: https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>When you've updated your file, once again commit directly to master or make a branch and a pull request.</li>
</ol>

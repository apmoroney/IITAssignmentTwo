Hi team! Let's put our individual reflections here. After which, someone can write a short summary. Then, we can put it into whichever html file we choose.

Working with Group 7 has been an absolute treat. There has been a theme of helpfulness and everybody is keen to do their bit. A wide range of skillsets from the members has been hugely beneficial.  Andew and Helen jumped in early on to set up some of the things we'd need to work effectively (Discord channel for communications, Smartsheets for interactive checklists to allow for a clear overview of what needs to happen and who's assigned to the tasks). John with his experience of HTML/CSS/front end coding and github has been able to take the lead on website design, and has been assisting us with how to approach both. Sam had the time to leap straight into the assignment content.  The team overall has been very responsive and helpful where required. Everyone is keen to work together, and everyone's want to do well by the assignment and by each other has been lovely.  This is with the exception of group member Chris who was late to joining our comms channels, and who is yet to present any work that they'd put their hand up to do. When I refer to everything going well, I am refering to the interactions between Helen, John, Andrew, Sam and myself.  Because the rest of the team has been working diligently and cohesively, Chris' absence has thankfully not made a strong impact on the effectiveness of the team.

Working on this assignment with the members of Group 7 has been a great experience. Everyone was ready to put their hand up quickly to take on a task that needed attention, and we were all ready to help each other out when help was asked for.
Andrew was quick to set up a Discord channel for everyone to communicate on. We were in constant communication throughout the whole assignment period and as such didn’t need to set up specific meetings. Andrew, Ben and Helen were all quick off the mark to get the team organised. The Discord channel as I mentioned, Google Docs to write out a plan and key points, and a Smartsheet document to track who was doing what task, their progress, and important comments. Sam was quick to take on tasks and used his time well to produce content and help review other member’s content.
Everyone was prompt and diligent with updating files on the GitHub repository and communicating progress with the other group members. The only exception was Chris, who was late to join the conversation and then quickly dropped out of communication. This was due to circumstances outside his control, and unfortunately he had to quit the project and the subject before completion. Luckily this did not affect the team or our progress. As I said, everyone was ready to work and help out where needed. I feel lucky to be part of such a great team.

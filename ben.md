DRAFT: Ideal Jobs Description and similarities:

Hi Team!
To get started, please click on Name > Bookmark to go to the summary, have a quick read through, and update it or change it if you feel I’ve missed something or misunderstood something.  

At the end of the summary of each job, I’ve left a “Themes of Comparison” list - Don’t worry about what’s in there at the moment, I’m going to use that information to make a pretty graph.

I COULD USE YOUR INSIGHT: I’ve never tried making a graph before. Could you please check out the radar graph used in the Summary/Comparison page, and let me know if it’s good or if it’s rubbish? If you have suggestions on how to display that information in a clearer manner, I would love to hear them. :)

I’ll check back in a week to finalise everything and of course, will delete this cover page for submission.

Summary of Jobs and Similarities between them:

Note to Group7: I’m still in the process of fleshing out this comparison/summary!

While all roles require some form of technical expertise with coding, the motivations to learn differs amongst team members  - Some wish to develop their technical skills to be able to help others, and some wish to develop technical skills for their own learning and engagement.

The graph below shows a number of things:
All of our jobs require some front end programming knowledge, whereas only a few of them require back end coding knowledge. It shows that some people are looking to have a wide and diverse skill set whereas others are more interested in honing their knowledge in a particular field. It shows that all of these jobs require some expertise with coding, but only one of them specifically requires an understanding of networking and security.



Burning Man Data - // Messy, incomplete thoughts below. Still adding and refining. Very draft.


Summary thoughts:
Very few of us were interested in security, networking, systems admin or testing. While some of us were interested in creative web app development, only one of the team member’s ideal jobs explicitly mentioned graphic design.  


IT Skills:

Interesting things of note:
UX designers are not in demand but graphics designers are...
General “Developer” and “Full Stack Developer” positions are note as in demand as Front End Developers
Back and development seems to be more in demand - Java, .NET
Of course, senior positions are less in demand.  

Will make a graph outlining our collective skill set against the burning man data.

IT Skills that we cover:
Strong: .NET, JavaScript, SQL

Business Management
Project Management


General Skills that we cover:

Interesting things of note:
The demand for communications skills alone nearly amounts to the next top three in demand general skills. However, being “Articulate” is the third least demanded skill set.  This leads me to believe that the graphs provided by which we measure our team’s viability and collective skill set value, is ambiguous and in places arbitrary. It seems that there are multiple components of “communication skills” separately listed. So if we combined them together under the “communication skills’ umbrella (‘Writing’ and ‘Articulation’ are forms of communication), then the chasm between Communication Skills and the next item on the demand list widens further.


Communication Skills: We’re strong!
Problem Solving: Arguably, all programming requires problem solving: We’re strong!
Organisational Skils: Not many of our listed jobs explicitly involve organisational skills…?
Writing: Preparing reports is listed for a few of our listed jobs.
Team Work / Collaboration: ~Half of us have mentioned this
TroubleShooting: Is this not a subset of problem solving?
Planning: 



Top Job Title Demand

In demand:

Ben - Solutions Architect
Andrew (and John?) - Graphics Designer
.NET Developer

Not as in demand:
Web devs, UX designers (John/Andrew)
Full Stack developer



Strong progress toward calculating how 'in demand' our group members are in relation to the 2018 burning glass data:

Not yet complete but a great foundation to work from over the next day or so.

Summary of Jobs and Similarities between them:

Note to Group7: I’m still in the process of fleshing out this comparison/summary!

While all roles require some form of technical expertise with coding, the motivations to learn differs amongst team members  - Some wish to develop their technical skills to be able to help others, and some wish to develop technical skills for their own learning and engagement.

The graph below shows a number of things:
All of our jobs require some front end programming knowledge, whereas only a few of them require back end coding knowledge. It shows that some people are looking to have a wide and diverse skill set whereas others are more interested in honing their knowledge in a particular field. It shows that all of these jobs require some expertise with coding, but only one of them specifically requires an understanding of networking and security.



Burning Man Data - // Messy, incomplete thoughts below. Still adding and refining. Very draft.


Summary thoughts:
Very few of us were interested in security, networking, systems admin or testing. While some of us were interested in creative web app development, only one of the team member’s ideal jobs explicitly mentioned graphic design.  


While it is likely there are some In-Demand skills that would be required for our ideal jobs (Microsoft Windows), these skills were not explicitly mentioned in the ideal job ads that were referred to for summarising the demand of our group, and thus were omitted. The information shown below is a strict comparison between what was outlined by the individual ideal job summaries and in the ads provided by Group7 members, and what is listed in the Burning Glass data.  

With this in mind, some of the findings when presented as numerical comparisons may appear to score poorly, but Group7 trusts that it is not because the group is undesirable by Burning Glass metrics, but that our ideal jobs did not explicitly mention some of the desirable skills that would be presumed to be required for the job.


IT Skills:

Interesting things of note:
UX designers are not in demand but graphics designers are...
General “Developer” and “Full Stack Developer” positions are note as in demand as Front End Developers
Back and development seems to be more in demand - Java, .NET
Of course, senior positions are less in demand.  

Will make a graph outlining our collective skill set against the burning man data.

IT Skills that we cover:
Strong: .NET, JavaScript, SQL

Business Management
Project Management


General Skills that we cover:

Interesting things of note:
The demand for communications skills alone nearly amounts to the next top three in demand general skills. However, being “Articulate” is the third least demanded skill set.  This leads me to believe that the graphs provided by which we measure our team’s viability and collective skill set value, is ambiguous and in places arbitrary. It seems that there are multiple components of “communication skills” separately listed. So if we combined them together under the “communication skills’ umbrella (‘Writing’ and ‘Articulation’ are forms of communication), then the chasm between Communication Skills and the next item on the demand list widens further.


Communication Skills: We’re strong!
Problem Solving: Arguably, all programming requires problem solving: We’re strong!
Organisational Skils: Not many of our listed jobs explicitly involve organisational skills…?
Writing: Preparing reports is listed for a few of our listed jobs.
Team Work / Collaboration: ~Half of us have mentioned this
TroubleShooting: Is this not a subset of problem solving?
Planning: 



Top Job Title Demand

In demand:

Ben - Solutions Architect
Andrew (and John?) - Graphics Designer
.NET Developer

Not as in demand:
Web devs, UX designers (John/Andrew)
Full Stack developer


**Updated: 9/7/2020, 9:43pm: 
Strong progress toward calculating how 'in demand' our group members are in relation to the 2018 burning glass data:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kp_ULdh33dknpYG2k-D9nKL1Xb3Jzg3FQZM_eo4GbQA/edit?usp=sharing

Not yet complete but a great foundation to work from over the next day or so.

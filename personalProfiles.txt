Hi My name is Sam. I am 29 and live in Brisbane. I love camping and exploring 
the less touched places of Australia. My interest in IT has mainly been through 
gaming, however coding interests me a lot. I have no formal education in IT, however,
 I have completed a few online introductory courses on JavaScript and HTML/CSS.

Hello! My name is Ben, I’m from Perth. I’m a gamer and a musician, and love learning 
about all sorts of new things, especially in the realms of movement 
(parkour, martial arts), philosophy, music, psychology and now, all things IT.  
I love exploring the world around us, and so exploring this digital age and how 
we interact with it is right up my alley.  I’m fairly fresh to the field of IT, 
but have had a little experience with HTML and CSS, and have helped to manage and 
maintain wordpress websites.

Hi my name is Andrew. I am 26 years old and live in West Gippsland, Victoria. I 
enjoy catching up with friends over a drink in the city, and traveling within Australia
 and internationally. I have limited experience in IT, but have basic knowledge of SQL, 
 HTML, CSS and using the Adobe Creative Suite products. I’m looking forward to learning 
 more about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, and software development.

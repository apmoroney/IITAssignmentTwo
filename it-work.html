              <p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Samantha Gloede:
                </strong><br />So I work at KPMG, which is one of the big four consulting and audit advisory firms. And
                I&#39;ve been with KPMG for 22 years, so I&#39;m probably older than like a lot of people in this team.
                And so I started I went to Murdoch University in Perth and I did a commerce degree with a double major
                in computer science and accounting. And at the time, (I graduated in like ninety-eight) so I was going
                through like recruiting sort of stuff for internships a couple of years before that, and I saw some ads
                from my so my competitors like KPMG, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ernst &amp; Young and Deloitte. And at the
                time there were six of us. And they&#39;ve you know, there&#39;s been acquisitions and they&#39;ve
                joined together. So now there&#39;s four of us. And I at the time, it was like not very common to have a
                business degree combined with any kind of technology degree. And I credit our mum for suggesting that I
                do that, she was like, I don&#39;t know why, but I think something to do with computers. You&#39;re
                really good at it, and I feel like it&#39;s the way of the future. So I went ahead and did the computer
                science double major. And at the time the big consulting firms were really interested in getting people
                that could understand business, but also, could understand IT and throughout my career, I think that the
                value proposition there has been, if you can help business people understand technology and how it helps
                to drive and enable a business, and it&#39;s becoming more and more important as new technologies are
                coming in. And really nowadays, people that work in business have to have a foundational education in
                technology, and I know certainly that often, but most of our clients, they typically don&#39;t recruit
                people now that don&#39;t have a technology credential of some sort, because you have to be able to
                understand and operate with technology. So I started I did internships at all. And I started I did a
                couple of summer internships and just started at KPMG and haven&#39;t gone back. Twenty two years later,
                I don&#39;t feel like it&#39;s been the same job. I&#39;ve worked, I&#39;ve worked in Sydney. I&#39;ve
                worked in I&#39;ve lived and worked in the United States of New York. I&#39;ve spent a ton of time in
                Asia, in all of the countries. When I was living in Perth and Sydney, I had an ASPAC role. So I went and
                met clients and did a lot of work across the region. Now that I&#39;m in a global role, I have clients
                in the US, in Europe, in Asia. I kind of work all over the place, and why I thought that it would be
                interesting to talk to you guys, So I do technology consulting and it&#39;s focused more on technology
                risk. So it&#39;s cyber security. It&#39;s all of the other risks that exist that Technology can either
                control and manage or that technology introduce us to a business. And we do all of those things. And
                more and more these days, technology risk is less about fixing stuff that goes wrong, but more involved
                in the strategy and design stage of any big project, because you have to have an understanding of
                technology and how to implement it in a secure and integral way to drive successful business
                implementation. So it&#39;s becoming more and more important. So I focus on technology risk. But at
                KPMG, our technology consultants to everything from the risk side that I do to actual implementations of
                technology. So implementing an Oracle system for the finance function or workday for the H.R. function
                so big like ERP implementations for big organizations we do. We have data scientists that do data and
                analytics are now data is you (sorry I sound American) data is in everything that any organization in,
                in anything that anyone does and that the value from that data comes from like analyzing it, using
                cognitive technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning to run routines like in real time
                over that data and create insight. So we have people that do that. And all of those things our group are
                participating in that, because you need to make sure that there&#39;s integrity in the outputs, you have
                to make sure that there&#39;s security and that the data isn&#39;t accessed by people that it
                shouldn&#39;t. It&#39;s ethical constraints as well. When you&#39;re looking at algorithms that are run
                on data, you want to make sure that they know there&#39;s no bias around gender or race or religion or.
                Geographical location. Anything else? It could be any kind of fire. So there&#39;s a lot of stuff that
                we do in technology, and so I thought it would be interesting because we have exposure to all of the
                components of technology roles at our clients. So I thought I could answer - I know when I saw the
                overview of your assignment, It&#39;s talking a lot about like what could your job be in technology? And
                I think it can be anything from like working on a help desk to help people with tactical I.T. issues. It
                could be actually being the engineer or the architect That&#39;s like connecting hardware to implement
                it. It could be the architects that are designing how that technology fits together and how it supports
                the business. It could be the business strategists that think about this as is what I need our business
                to do. And this is how the technology is going to support us doing that. It could be the cyber security.
                It could be the data and analytics engineers and data scientists. Is this like so many different things
                that you can do in technology? So I thought I could probably answer pretty much most questions about the
                different types of roles. And also, when I saw the list of the technologies that were in your
                assignment. I&#39;ve done work with almost all of them. So I&#39;d love if you&#39;ve got questions and
                it doesn&#39;t even have to be on the video. Now, like, if you have questions in the next few weeks as
                you&#39;re doing it, I can talk about like how those technologies are typically used by organizations
                and it&#39;s different depending on the industry that the organization works in. But I can kind of help
                you guys understand, how those technologies are used in everyday life. So they&#39;re amazing.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Ben Matthews:
                </strong><br />Andrew, Helen Do you guys have questions? I certainly got a few, but I&#39;ll wait.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Andrew Moloney:
                </strong><br />Oh, not now. I&#39;m I&#39;m happy just to run with what you guys have got. Yeah.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Helen Nowlan :
                </strong><br />Theres a couple</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Ben Matthews:
                </strong><br />While Helen&#39;s finding something. Yeah. So, I mean, you&#39;ve obviously worked those
                across so many different facets of tech business. Well, it&#39;s really, really exciting. I mean,
                I&#39;m curious about things like you mentioned, bias in algorithms and all the rest of it and what I
                can do to skew data. Oh, yeah. Rather like is that something that is common where algorithms actually do
                have, you know, just maybe like they&#39;re not really fully considered or something.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Samantha Gloede:
                </strong><br />Yeah. So I think it&#39;s unintentionally common. I don&#39;t think anyone ever. I think
                for the most case, they&#39;re designed in a way that&#39;s intended to do what they&#39;re meant to do.
                However, there are some scenarios where people like bad actors can leverage that influence that they
                have to get the answers that they want to get to give it almost in like sort of a propaganda kind of
                way. If they want to say, well, this is what the data says and it&#39;s and it benefits that business.
                Right. So we always go in with the expectation that algorithms are written and designed for the best
                case output in a fair and integrity driven way, but there&#39;s many examples where it isn&#39;t done in
                that way and they are easily manipulated. The other thing is that machine learning is just that.
                It&#39;s about machines learning the rhythms, the routines, the personalities, the activities and the
                actions of the of the data that they are running on and the people the uses of that data. So you&#39;ll
                find that algorithms in the early days are possibly not as accurate or as broad in their access as they
                will be maybe in a month down the track or, you know, some sort of longer duration. But we have a
                solution that we have partnered with IBM, one side IBM provide the technology and we provide the data
                scientists and the consultants who can analyze the outputs, and we call it AI in control and like jokew
                word we don&#39;t give to the general public is &quot;bots gone wild&quot; because they actually really
                can go wild, either intentionally or unintentionally. So we have this solution that we built with IBM
                where basically we in input parameters into the IBM system that will analyze the algorithm to make sure
                that there&#39;s integrity so that there is completeness and accuracy in what it&#39;s doing, that
                it&#39;s free from bias. So it could be any of those things I mentioned before, it could be gender
                based, religion based, geographically based, politically based, like anything. And also that, fairness
                so that that output&#39;s are fair based on what has gone in, where the data&#39;s come from and that
                it&#39;s been sourced in a fair way, so an algorithm could be running perfectly well with complete
                integrity. But if the source data is kind of dicey, then the output won&#39;t be a fair response. So
                they&#39;re the sort of solutions that we create to help check on that sort of stuff.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Ben Matthews:
                </strong><br />Amazing, and so in that sense, do you essentially apply a machine learning to scan the
                algorithm themselves, is that kind of the process. </p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Samantha Gloede:
                </strong><br />We kind of do. So we will - the system that IBM created allows us to input parameters
                that we think it needs to be checked against because it could depend. Is it a life sciences company or a
                pharmaceutical company that&#39;s creating a covert vaccine right now and using data to do that? Is it a
                bank that is worried about credit risk right now because everyone&#39;s lost their job and they
                can&#39;t pay the credit card?</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Helen Nowlan : </strong><br />I
                was going to say to you is COVID having a huge impact in this area.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Samantha Gloede:
                </strong><br />Huge, huge huge huge on everything. On absolutely everything. So we&#39;ve done a lot of
                pivoting in what we do right now to make sure that we are only really investing in and taking solutions
                to market that our clients are going to need because of COVID. So it depends on on the industry. So I
                have worked across many industries in the past, but right now I&#39;m focused on life sciences. So
                that&#39;s pharmaceutical companies, medical device. So anything to do with, like diagnostics, so
                testing, that sort of stuff. And in our space, there&#39;s a lot of things that are critical right now
                for them because of COVID. It&#39;s about the security of the IP, but also the physical location where
                they are testing people&#39;s COVID tests, where they&#39;re researching treatments and vaccinations.
                It&#39;s very, very competitive. So there&#39;s a lot of like cyber risk related to that right now
                because hackers want to get in and see what is the recipe for this vaccination that this company is is
                doing versus another. Right. So that&#39;s one thing. Another thing that&#39;s a really big issue right
                now across many industries, not just life sciences is supply chain. So we&#39;re very dependent,
                certainly in the US. But I think across most of the world, very dependent on supply chain in China. And
                it could be production of materials. It could be the raw ingredients that are produced somewhere else.
                It could be, you know, all of that. Right. We get Iphones and Ipads at a cheap price because they&#39;re
                made in China. But there&#39;s a lot of political unrest with that right now, and so what we&#39;re
                seeing is a lot of our clients have supply chain risk where they either can&#39;t source it from where
                they sourced it before, and that drives supply volume issues and price issues, but also because
                there&#39;s so much demand for products that they never needed before, like face masks and gloves and
                shields and syringes and everything that the whole world needs, they&#39;ve had to really quickly pivot
                to figure out how on earth are we going to produce these things in a way that we&#39;re not dependent on
                China. So that has implications across every organization and from KPMG&#39;s perspective, it&#39;s not
                just technology, we actually have people that deal with like optimizing that process. From a technology
                standpoint, we can help with the resilience of the technology that supports the supply chain. We can
                help with the security of the supply chain. So you to say like these are a few examples where it just
                shows technology is the foundation of everything that every organization does. Another one is in the
                U.S. and I think it happened a bit in Australia, too. But they had this three trillion dollar government
                stimulus package where organizations, small businesses could apply for a loan to keep paying their
                employees while they could have work. And so we KPMG helped a lot of these big banks processing all of
                the applications, doing assessments on like potential fraud of the applications because there&#39;s
                people applying for it that shouldn&#39;t have applied for it. So all of these things and it&#39;s like
                super interesting. And I, I, I thought it would be cool to talk about this stuff with you guys, because
                sometimes I know when I was at uni studying I.T., I kind of thought well all I&#39;ll do is I&#39;ll go
                and work in an I.T. department. And that&#39;s certainly a very, very good offer opportunity. But I
                don&#39;t want you to all think like that&#39;s all you can do because you could go and work in like a
                full on business and your technology will be an integral part of that. So like the big banks will have,
                you know, the bank is at the front that are dealing with the clients. But in every business unit of the
                bank, this Technologist&#39;s, they&#39;re working with people in the front office to help them do what
                they do. So I think it&#39;s super exciting. I&#39;m a nerd</p>

                love it. I really like all things IT and business and how it all intersects. I get the impression that
                part of why you&#39;re so engaged by it is because it&#39;s so varied.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Samantha Gloede:
                </strong><br />It is. I&#39;ve never been bored.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Ben Matthews:
                </strong><br />It&#39;s like not only is it varied, but it&#39;s not just like you just jump from these
                kind of menial tasks to another menial tasks like everything. You know, it&#39;s multifaceted and really
                engaging as well. So yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Really cool. So I mean, what is that something that
                you love about your job is having the opportunity for constantly varied engagement and working with
                clients from different locations and constantly suiting different needs and all the rest of it.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Samantha Gloede:
                </strong><br />Yeah, that definitely appealed to me because I even I&#39;ve been there 22 years. I
                don&#39;t feel like it&#39;s been the same job. I&#39;ve worked in so many different places. I&#39;ve
                worked in so many different types of roles. But the foundation has always been kind of technology risk.
                And that&#39;s what I do. I mean, I&#39;m very biased. I think working in a consulting firm particularly
                one of the big four because they&#39;re so grounded in like a brand recognition around, like trust and
                business process. Like, we really know what we&#39;re doing. I think that&#39;s a really good option
                because you can really do anything if you decide, like you get really good training up front. You get a
                really good foundation for three years if you decide I don&#39;t want to do this consulting business any
                more. Going to a bank or any other organization after working at the firm KPMG. It&#39;s it speaks a lot
                on the resume. Because they know you&#39;ve had really solid training. You&#39;ve had exposure to
                different industries, to different functions. So we have people that work in specifically in an
                industry. So I&#39;m life sciences, we have people in banking, we have people in consumer and retail. We
                have people in technology and media. And we have people in healthcare. We have people in government and
                defense and energy and natural resources. So the big mining companies and the big energy companies, so
                we can kind of work in any industry that you have an interest in. But also you can switch between the
                functions so you might decide to specialize in finance or in H.R. or marketing or tech I.T. or cyber and
                you can do all of that stuff and it just completely changes. You know, you don&#39;t feel like
                you&#39;re doing the same job. But at the same time, like as a business, we also have a very, very, very
                big technology organization that support us in what we do. So we have our own CISO who manages cyber
                security for our business, which is also really, really important because we have very sensitive access
                to information. We have our own CIO who and chief data officer who drives the strategy for our firm
                globally around like what hardware are we going to use? What software are we going to use? What how do
                we support, you know, a couple hundred thousand people across the globe, like traveling and working
                remotely? That&#39;s another thing right now with COVID, because everybody&#39;s working away from the
                office, working remotely from a technology standpoint, like it&#39;s a big issue because they need to
                ensure availability of the technology so people don&#39;t have downtime when they&#39;re working from
                home. So if you&#39;ve got. You know, an organization that has like 20000 people that used to work in
                the office on those like hardwired service and an Internet access that was in their office, and now
                they&#39;re all working from home from God knows where. Yeah. How do you make sure that I&#39;ve got
                availability of the technology to do that job? How do you make sure that this its secure like theres So
                many different components to that. And that&#39;s a lot of the stuff we&#39;re during for clients right
                now is helping them with remote access to make sure that their workforce to keep working.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Ben Matthews:
                </strong><br />Yeah, yeah, yeah. That&#39;d be massive one. We&#39;ve actually just been reading a
                little bit about, like, you know, the whole bring your own device to work kind of mentality and what
                that means for things like cost to the business and security. Mm hmm.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Andrew Moloney:
                </strong><br />Yeah, I did have mentioned in regards to the security from your client&#39;s perspective.
                What about KPMG?</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Samantha Gloede:
                </strong><br />Yes. It&#39;s important for two fronts. So we have an enormous risk management function
                in our business, so we our firm has three functions, audit. So that&#39;s the external audit of any big
                organization that has to report to shareholders. Right. So they do a financial audit. That&#39;s a big
                part. The second is our tax business. So they do anything related to tax. And it&#39;s not just like the
                year end on quarterly tax. It&#39;s like very significant, like, you know, understanding if you want to
                build a supply chain and source stuff from one part of the world that has big tax benefits or not.
                Right. So they do a lot of that complex tax structuring stuff. And then we have our advisory business,
                which is our consulting business where I sit. So we have a lot of restrictions ourselves. So I can&#39;t
                work on anything for an audit client in a consulting capacity because there would be independence
                concerns that we might have access to financial information that we could use to benefit other
                shareholders or whatever. Right. So there&#39;s this big segregation there. But with that comes with you
                know bad actors have people that might hack or do bad things. They know that we have access to really
                sensitive data. We can. We have access to financial information. And our clients have really big down to
                not so big, but like the biggest in Australia, like the biggest banks are our clients. The biggest
                pharma, like all of the big clients are ours. So if anyone wanted to get access to really sensitive
                information we have, that&#39;s there&#39;s a lot of security requirements from a technology standpoint.
                And we have to when we go through an engagement acceptance for every single job I do, we have to like
                agree that we&#39;re not going to take certain data from the client onto our laptops. And if we do, it
                is it&#39;s like so, you know, we use Microsoft teams for our virtual meetings right now and we are not
                allowed to like type of client name into the chat. Right. Because so there&#39;s of behavioral
                restrictions, but also as security people have to enforce a lot of technology restrictions on what how
                we can share information like we&#39;re not allowed to use Dropbox when I&#39;m allowed to use Icloud,
                we&#39;re not allowed to access a G mail account on our work computer. Right. So there&#39;s a lot of
                restrictions there. But also theres restrictions in the way that we contract with our clients so that
                they have to agree to to what they will allow us to access and agree to those restrictions. So it&#39;s
                not just on us, but the responsibility of a CISO So the chief information security officer for us is
                just as important as it would be for the Commonwealth Bank or example,</p>

                </strong><br />Probably more important cause you would have multiple banks.</p>

                </strong><br />Johnny Had a question Ill just ask that. How do you see your field developing in the
                future? Do you expect many changes as technology improves or processes becomes automated?</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Samantha Gloede: </strong><br />I
                think that&#39;s a great question. I think in my career, we are more valued now than we&#39;ve ever
                been. So it&#39;s very exciting. And not just within our firm, but like what we do for our clients is
                much more strategic. Now, I think, like 10, 15 years ago. We were more like the fixing thing. It was
                like the boring stuff that they didn&#39;t really want. It&#39;s not that sexy, like doing what we did.
                Now they involve us right up front in, like, C level discussions. I think one of the maybe I didn&#39;t
                send it through, but we did a CEO sent a CIO survey. But we did a CEO survey of like, I don&#39;t know,
                fifteen hundred CEOs of clients around the world that we work for and technology is like in the top
                aspects of technology, a probably like the majority of their top five concerns. So it&#39;s really
                important for them. I also think that the expansion of disruptive and emerging technologies like
                artificial intelligence, machine learning, block chain and crypto currencies, cloud connected devices
                like all of those things are being used more and more and more by organizations to disrupt and change
                and transform the way that they operate that Now we are becoming even more important, not and not just
                make KPMG. I mean, like the technologists that implement this for our clients are becoming much more
                important because nobody else really understands what these technologies do and how they can help drive
                value for the business. And it&#39;s so competitive these days that these organizations don&#39;t
                automate and digitize the way they operate, whether it be with the customers or the way that they
                operate that business with their employees and everything in between, then they&#39;re going to lose
                money. They are going to lose customers. They&#39;re going to be taken over by other people. So these
                technologies are becoming. So so, so, so important, really.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Helen Nowlan :
                </strong><br />From a cyber security point, do you find that you tend to be reactive to hackers or do
                you stay a step ahead of them?</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Samantha Gloede:
                </strong><br />That&#39;s a great question to so Historically, we were more reactive and there&#39;s
                definitely a piece of what we do that has to be reactive. So something will happen and you have to fix
                it. But the value for Any organization in this security organization now, if they call it security by
                design. So you want to design your technology architecture so that it&#39;s secure from the outset
                because it&#39;s better to prevent these things than resolve them. So there&#39;s that element of
                designing a better security architecture up front, and that&#39;s part of the Cyber organization. But
                also now the exciting thing is you can use technologies like artificial intelligence, like I say,
                cognitive technologies that artificial intelligence, machine learning, any of those sort of things. You
                can and we do a lot of this work with our clients where we show them how they could create those
                technologies on top of what they do to better anticipate something happening. So now most organizations
                and I&#39;m sure any of the people you work for or with. Now, whatever jobs you have to today as well as
                your university? I would have some sort of cognitive technology that is scanning absolutely every
                interaction and digital fingerprint that exists anywhere, whether it&#39;s an email, whether it&#39;s
                someone logging into a portal, whether it&#39;s an employee that works there, that&#39;s like looking on
                a Web site that is not related to what they do or is not. Theres algorithms that help organizations
                understand have we got what they call an insider threat. Sois there someone working within our
                organization that&#39;s potentially going to hack or provide access to a hacker externally or they are
                outside threats that we can anticipated And this stuff is all automated and it&#39;s all happening
                without any of us knowing. That&#39;s why I have two phones, because I know KPMG can see absolutely
                every single thing I do on my personal phone That&#39;s why I have two now And It&#39;s becoming more
                and more important to anticipate and predict risk than to fix it at the end, because if, if and if an
                incident happens, then theres reputational damage, this financial damage. And it&#39;s really hard to
                come back from that. So the preference is to just anticipate.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Helen Nowlan : </strong><br />So
                there might be a fine line between risk and privacy. Saying that you have to have two phones.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Samantha Gloede:
                </strong><br />Yeah, right, sir. I know as an employee of KPMG, but I sign when I Every year do my
                declaration I give them . I know that they have access to my phone and my computer and I have every
                right to right?. It&#39;s my choice to use that for personal use or not. But I know that they can access
                it as a consumer I think the privacy side is like super interesting. Already talked you about that. So
                there&#39;s a couple of big regulations. So in Europe, it&#39;s GDPR I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve
                heard of that. The general data privacy regulation and then in the United States, they&#39;re starting
                to do it by state. So the first one that happened was in California, it&#39;s called the California
                Consumer Privacy Act, and every state is starting to define their own regulations. And basically,
                that&#39;s that&#39;s protecting consumers now. So every organization that has access to a consumer
                information has to inform them of how they are using it and inform them if there&#39;s any potential
                risk to that. And if they don&#39;t really strictly abide by these regulations there&#39;s significant
                financial penalty. So the European one in GDPR There was definitely penalty, but it was more like
                process related. Whereas in the U.S., it&#39;s financial. So if you are in California, if you&#39;re a
                California resident as a person or a resident as a business, and if you find out that your data, either
                your company or your personal data has been exposed or misappropriated in any way, you can seek
                financial remuneration. So for every instance for a person its seven hundred and fifty dollars and every
                instance for an organization, it&#39;s like seven and a half thousand by instance It could be they have
                your name, your state, your address, your credit card. And they used it inappropriately like 50 times.
                Then you get 750 dollars times 50. Right. So organizations to make sure that they have privacy controls.
                And and that&#39;s not just control. It&#39;s like how they organize the whole data, like they spending
                with us. I mean, my client that I&#39;m working on right now, we&#39;re at about, I dont know six
                million dollars already in helping them work through that. So its significant risk and significant
                costs, it&#39;s very, very important. And it&#39;s just you have to kind of think of it through the lens
                of whether it&#39;s an employee that agrees to use technology in a certain way or a consumer who assumes
                that they can trust an organization that they are engaging with. So much to talk about.</p>

                thing I thought I would mention is that I know in the list There were different technologies and which
                one of been has received blockchain and cryptocurrency.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Andrew Moloney: </strong><br />Im
                so sorry my internet keeps dropping out. </p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Samantha Gloede:
                </strong><br />That&#39;s alright. I just wanted to, I might give you like a quick synopsis, but then if
                you want to ask questions, you can email me. blockchain and cryptocurrency is like super, super
                confusing even for us And also the regulators, they don&#39;t really understand what it is and how to it
                and all of that. So I thought I would just give a couple of examples of how it can be used to maybe help
                you understand, like what it is and why it&#39;s used. So blockchain I&#39;m going to try and explain
                this in like the simplest terms. It&#39;s basically like a database technology that removes any ability
                to change or erase records. So there&#39;s no way, if something is submitted through a block chain that
                anybody can ever change its lineage. It started here. It&#39;s here now. Nothing can be modified. So
                there&#39;s a real, like ability to trace data and where it goes. And the reason that that&#39;s really
                important. Sorry I&#39;ll talk about a couple of industry use cases. For in Australia blockchain we do a
                lot of work in blockchain with like agriculture and the food supply chain and wineries. Because
                basically every single ingredient into a food that ends up on the grocery shelf or organic produce
                that&#39;s come from a farm that then goes through different traces or the wheat that ends up in.
                There&#39;s a lot of value in organizations being able to prove the lineage of that supply chain. So
                that&#39;s one of the use cases there in the U.S. theres a there&#39;sregulation called the Drugs Supply
                Chain Security Act, and it doesn&#39;t enforce the use of blockchain but blockchain is really the only
                way that any pharmaceutical company can actually real realistically like comply to this regulation. So a
                blockchain technology is used to basically show the flow of every ingredient that goes into a drug, that
                goes into a lab that is created, that gets sent to a pharmacy, that gets sent to a doctor, that gets
                injected into a patient. So there&#39;s no it&#39;s sort of reducing Any counterfeit drugs? It&#39;s
                reducing the ability for doctors to be prescribing people to go to like multiple doctors and get
                multiple prescriptions of the same thing. And then one other use cases, like in the luxury goods
                industry. So in France, we do a lot of work with Louis Vuitton, right, in Hennessy. And so they are in
                like the champagne business, the designer goods business. And it&#39;s a big business to copy and have
                counterfeit items in the luxury business. So they have adopted a blockchain to basically trace their
                entire supply chain from the goods right through to the consumer. So theres a lot of like implications
                of that is a lot of risk is a lot of like technology ability to implement a blockchain. But I just
                thought that might help you guys understand outside of, like, the Big Term. I mean, I remember when I
                first started working with it I was like, I&#39;ve got no idea what this thing is and what it does.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Andrew Moloney:
                </strong><br />That was really that was a really great explanation as well. And while I&#39;ve been
                researching it through doing this assignment all the. Sort of the category with blockchain and crypto
                currencies, but I want to not harp on about Bitcoin. So through my research Well, I signed off on a case
                study on pharmaceuticals. I&#39;m sorry, I was just saying that during my research I did stumble upon
                the case study using like pharmaceuticals and tracking pharmaceuticals and counterfeit drugs. Yet
                another thing I stumbled on was using it for voting.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Samantha Gloede:
                </strong><br />Yeah, anything you want. Like, no doubt about who has access to where it&#39;s come from.
                It&#39;s like the perfect. So I&#39;ve said that over here, like the US election is happening in
                November And the system here is just like so antiquated And it&#39;s so. So rife for fraud. And, you
                know, regardless if Trump or Biden wins, there&#39;s no doubt because nobody can go and vote in person.
                Whoever wins and whoever loses is going to have some issue around, like the traceability and the
                integrity of the voting system. If this was set up on a block chain, it&#39;d be no you would not able
                to refute it.And so I would suggest when you do, I don&#39;t quite understand how you&#39;d have to
                report on these technologies. But I would suggest you, Andrew, like you should say, like. Most people
                will think of blockchain and crypto currencies being applied in financial services because that&#39;s
                kind of where it started. But the most transformational use cases of blockchain are in agriculture,
                food, luxury goods, farmers like Lifesciences. I mean, that stuffs the life science stuff is so
                important, so important because it&#39;s life and death. If people are taking a shitty drug that has
                come from Mexico instead of like New Jersey, they could die from that And it&#39;s, you know, it&#39;s I
                think. That is super exciting. I also think like another technology that&#39;s. I prefer to think more
                about like humanity&#39;s humanity and helping people live a better life. I think that connected
                devices. So like wellness. And it&#39;s not just like the watch you wear. It is the ability to do drug
                trials where it&#39;s a device that people consume. And then the drug research at the lab can see how
                that is working through the body and the cellular impact that the drug is having on the person. And you
                think about like the speed. So the reason they can create a vaccine in like a year versus 20 years for
                COVID is because they have these sort of technologies. If they didn&#39;t have that normally in the old
                days, a vaccination took 20 years to create like millions of people would die. And in a non COVID world
                like the use of those technologies allow people in Third World countries to get access to medical
                treatment that they ordinarily would have no access to. So I personally feel really passionate about
                technology and life sciences because I think it&#39;s going to help som many people.</p>

                </strong><br />Yeah. I have a different question if I have time for one more And so obviously, like long
                story short, the question is like are you able to talk about some of the worst days you&#39;ve had in
                your role and the things that have gone wrong. Is that the thing that you&#39;re allowed to talk about?
              </p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Samantha Gloede:
                </strong><br />Yeah, I can. </p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Ben Matthews: </strong><br />I
                just want to Get the best of that, like the highs and the lows of the drug.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Samantha Gloede: </strong><br />I
                definitely can. I can give you guys some big examples, too. Sorry, I lived in New York on September 11th
                And there&#39;s so many things about that day. So we I was working in downtown New York City. I&#39;m
                looking out there right now. And I was working on the audit for Citigroup. So one of the biggest banks
                in the world. And we also had a team that worked for Deutsche Bank, which is big German bank.And why
                back then? Gosh, it was like 20, 20 years ago. </p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Helen Nowlan : </strong><br />I
                cant believe how long ago it was</p>
              <p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Samantha Gloede:
                </strong><br />So About 10 years ago. Crazy. So at the time, we didn&#39;t have proper backup So we
                would just once every month drop a copy of our server off to the other office. Didn&#39;t think anything
                of it. Both buildings collapsed on that day and we were nine months into a twelve month audit. We lost
                every hard copy because the building burtn down. We lost our soft copies. So we had somehow we were able
                to sign off the audit that year. God knows how, but like, that was a pretty big scenario. And I remember
                at the time, like one of the big areas that we focus on is around, like business continuity and
                resilience. And that was. And it&#39;s sort of I guess we&#39;re in a similar situation now in a way,
                when such a massive disaster happens It doesn&#39;t really matter what backup or additional processes
                you have in place. If you don;t have the people there to do work and the technology to support it, you
                can&#39;t operate. And so back then, it was like limited to this geographical location in New York City.
                But now you&#39;re looking at a pandemic that&#39;s impacting every single country in the world and
                every single person. So it doesn&#39;t matter whether you are an executive that operates in like the
                most senior level or you&#39;re the person in the back office who is plugging in like the server room or
                you are the person doing the deliveries or you&#39;re the person taking the phone orders or whatever the
                hell it is that you do. Like every single person has been impacted. So. It&#39;s been Exciting in a way,
                to see how we can help our clients, but also incredibly stressful because you realize, like people are
                surviving right now and they can&#39;t afford to spend money on things. So they cutting a lot of the
                nice to haves and just spending on the absolute must haves. So that&#39;s been a huge impact to our
                business. I had another example also in New York where I was working for a telecommunications company
                that provided all of the technology for JFK Airport. And I remember I was sitting there, I was young at
                the time and. Not like I I was a manager, but like I was a new manager and I was really nervous and it
                was like when the first reports I was presenting on my own and there were a lot of findings, like we
                basically they had no backup. And I remember, like, they were arguing with me, it was like these big
                older men and they were like, you don;t know what you are talking about this never going to be this
                issue. And literally in the middle, I&#39;d said to them, like, either way, if you lost all
                connectivity, how would all of the airplanes continue to operate at JFK? And he said that would never
                happen. And then let&#39;s literally within five minutes, there was this massive blackout and all of New
                York, all of the whole state, was like blacked out and they lost every connection. JFK was completely
                grounded. So it was like the worst stressful situation. But it was kind of like the best time in my
                career because I was like But then also, like, we&#39;ve had security incidents that are really
                stressful where, you know, we were involved in trying to anticipate scenarios and hackers got in.
                That&#39;s not fun. We do really big projects for banks. They have a big regulation called Know Your
                Customer. And it&#39;s basically started around like the global financial crisis in 2008, where people
                were like fraudulently getting mortgages and loans and all this stuff or entering into like financial
                agreements that they couldn&#39;t sustain. And so now the banks have this massive regulatory requirement
                to go through this whole routine with every single customer, whether it&#39;s the person that gets a
                credit card to the like billionaire who&#39;s trading stocks with them And the cost of that is really
                significant. So, like we have a six hundred million dollar contract with a major bank to do that whole
                process with them for them And we had a big fuckup with our process. And it kind of wasn&#39;t working.
                And that was six hundred million dollars on the line. So I think that anything can really go wrong
                because technology can&#39;t you know, you&#39;re not God, you can&#39;t control everything. And I think
                that there is still an assumption that, like, if you&#39;re in technology, you know how to fix
                everything. You don&#39;t always know how to fix everything because anything can really go wrong. So, I
                we always tend to be Cautiously optimistic about things like this huge opportunity But we also very,
                very well aware that with technology supporting so much like so much can go wrong. And it can be pretty
                stressful to. As you guys are going through, like your degree, if ever you want advice on, like,
                companies to work for jobs to go for, like, Helen can put you in touch, I&#39;m totally happy to answer
                any questions, because what I do, I work with so many different roles in technology so I can probably
                help figure out, like, if it&#39;s a good fit or not. I&#39;m really happy to do that.</p>

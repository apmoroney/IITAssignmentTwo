Cyber security is essential in today's Corporate world and for all private citizens.  Our dependence on digital technologies is pervasive in everything we do professionally, and in our personal lives.  The capabilities of digital technologies continue to increase exponentially,  far exceeding  what was possible only a few decades ago.   As organizations globally engage with their customers, employees and other stakeholders digitally, the attraction and opportunity for cyber threat increases.  Our personal devices such as phones and laptops are used extensively for digital commerce.  And even our homes are digitally enabled and connected, such as front door locks, climate control, and fridges.  This allows for enormous convenience to our everyday lives, but it also opens us up to massive cyber risk.  

Cyber criminals are attempting to exploit and cash in on our need for information related to COVID-19. This coupled with the exponential shift to a remote workforce has exposed new opportunities for attacks by cyber criminals.  COVID-19 themed phishing campaigns (focused on personal information, fraud and financial crime, and ecommerce), were launched immediately as the World Health Organization’s declaration.   

The need for Cyber security has seen a huge rise and in a report on board priorities in the Harvey Nash & KPMG CIO survey 2019, we have seen a rise of its priority to 56% compared to 45% in 2018.  As seen in the below diagram, Cyber Security sits in the top 5 priorities for Chief Executive Officers, refer to [Nash & KPMG 3, pg.7] 
“CEO’s are no longer looking at Cyber risk as a separate topic.  More and more they have it embedded into their overall change programs and are beginning to make strategic decisions with cyber risk in mind.  It is no longer viewed as a standalone solution.” According to Tony Buffomante [2]

 While the potential of cyber threats is broad and ever evolving, following is an overview of the most common areas of focus of the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO): 
 
 Cyber Strategy & Governance. <Bold>
Organizations need to align their cyber security strategy to business priorities to ensure business resilience.  Key considerations being third party risk management, data privacy and governance, and cyber regulatory compliance.  Cyber crime is so sophisticated now and is very difficult to prevent, so the efforts need to be put into how to anticipate potential threat, and immediate and effective incident response.  

Cyber Defence  <Bold>
Cyber defence defends your important business data against cyber threats and attacks.  IN order to protect this data we use AI and ML to detect cyber threats, hopefully deter them by making it harder to breach your data and the ability to react and hopefully resolve and breaches or threats in a timely manner, hence reducing the risk of too much damage to your data.  Cyber defence involves security testing, security operations, application security, and insider threats.

Cyber response <Bold>
An important component to  cyber security is the manner in which an organization responds to cyber incidents and conducts forensic analysis and investigations on any breaches that occur within IT systems.   Cyber security professionals must ensure that they are constantly educated on current threats, that they have a process in place to quickly react to unknown threats, and have established processes to avoid future, more serious breaches wherever possible. 

Cloud & Artificial Intelligence Security <Bold>
Cloud platforms are heavily utilised in businesses today and must be protected from data, from leakage and deletion from external sources. This is done with firewalls, penetration testing, VPNs, encryption, tokenization, and avoiding public internet connections.  
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are playing increasing roles in cyber security with tools to analyse data and identify potential threats. AI can analyse enormous volumes of data and secure cyber attacks in a way that cannot be done manually.  AI can detect patterns of malicious behaviour and allow organisations to respond to threats faster and more effectively. [CIO Story, 6][D Palmer, 7]
All of the cyber security considerations I have discussed above have already been implemented, however in the next 3 years they will evolve and become more automated  with increased implementation of AI and ML technologies.   The application of these technologies will make cyber security more robust, and will allow more predictive insights on potential threats.
Cyber security is now considered a strategic imperative by the majority of CEOs, and is critical to the secure and successful implementation of digital and emerging technologies . Artificial Intelligence, Connected Devices, and Cloud are just some of the technologies and processes that require strong cyber security strategy, policies and controls. 
We really need to incorporate all of the above now.  It is available and ready to be utilised and investing in this area will inevitably save you more in the long run.  Breaches to data are costly and sometimes disastrous to businesses.  The large attacks not only burden companies financially but the loss of trust and credibility to their brands received from losing peoples data hits the bottom line as well. The threat can be repaired quickly but the credibility takes a lot longer to recover from, if ever. 

What is likely to change? <Bold>
Cyber security will remain a critical strategic imperative of all organisations, as there will continue to be an increase in  the frequency and complexity of internal and external cyber threats.  The change will be a continuing evolution of cyber security strategy to ensure proactive interception of threats, and swift and agile response., 
The COVID-19 pandemic is driving increased cyber threat,  some example scenarios are noted below: 
• In the Pharmaceutical industry, hackers are motivated to access the IP of COVID-19 treatments and vaccines.  As I write this assignment, CNN reports that Russian cyber actors are targeting organizations involved in COVID-19 vaccine development.  Securing the environment of clinical research and manufacturing security are front of mind for these organizations. [Fox & Kelion, 10]
• In the Retail industry, digital commerce has grown exponentially due to the wide closure of physical stores, so consumer personal and financial data is at increased risk of cyber crime. 
And as the US election is only months away, cyber criminals are motivated to  hack voting infrastructure, as well as mainstream media outlets in an attempt to influence the electoral outcomes.

  Who will be affected? <Bold>
Everyone! Employees, consumers, public and private enterprise, government organisations.  Strong cyber security strategies, processes and controls benefit all of these stakeholders, as much as each is potentially exposed to risk if something goes wrong.  The reliance on digital technology is only going to continue to increase and therefore cyber security will remain an imperative. 
I don't believe that Cyber security will replace or make jobs redundant.  AI will definitely create significant efficiencies and optimize certain cyber security activities, however the CISO and security professionals will continue to be critically important roles in any organization.  AI may remove the need for certain manual processes, however humans  will provide valuable insights on the outcomes of the AI, ultimately driving increased value from the cyber security function.  

In your daily life, how will it affect you how will it affect your family?
It affects me and my family in so many facets of life.  As a business owner, I must take out insurance to protect against cyber threats. My business holds client data and some health records, so it is imperative that it is as secure as possible.  It would harm my brand integrity and the trust I have developed with my clients if I were to be exposed to a security threat.  

It has the potential to personally affect me by taking my health details, financial details, and information about my life to be used externally for extortion or to sell to others. 

Cyber security could affect me as well by bringing downtime to my life and my business.  There are threats that can create electrical blackouts which would stop my ability to work, threats that can take valuable records and disclose my client databases, threats that can paralyse our phones and computer systems.  They can also cause identity theft. 

What will be different for you? <Bold>
  
After the research I have conducted for this assignment, I now have a solid understanding of the key themes of cybersecurity, and how these can impact individuals and organisations.  I understand and respect the requirements for strong cyber strategies, processes and controls.  With strong cyber security, organizations will have increased trust and credibility from their stakeholders.  If Cyber security is well implanted, organisations can gain more credibility with the consumers they are engaging with eg banks, governments etc. We can all do our part to ensure cyber security.  As businesses we can outsource or hire internally to ensure this area is give the resources necessary to be effective.   We can better enable collaboration between security team members. We can also set up tools to secure ourselves from cyber-attacks.  

Personally, I will ensure that I will practice better password hygiene, use anti-virus software, and be vigilant in opening potential phishing and scam emails.  [H Taylor, 8]

In conclusion, cybersecurity is a critical and imperative requirement in the design and implementation of digital technologies – for organizations and their key stakeholders alike.
